# Assuming 'functions.py' should have a valid operation between 'a' and 'b'.
# Here's the corrected code for 'functions.py':

def some_function(a, b):
    return a + b  # Example fix: Added '+' operator for addition

# Note: This assumes the intention was to return the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
# If the original operation was different, replace '+' with the correct operator.
